LinkedIn created groups back in 2004 — before they even had a mobile site! Despite being around a while, they’re one of the most underused features of the networking platform.

According to LinkedIn, Groups are “a place for professionals in the same industry or with similar interests to share content, find answers, post and view jobs, make business contacts, and establish themselves as industry experts.”

## Why LinkedIn Groups Matter

LinkedIn has pretty simple algorithms. For example, if someone writes an amazing post about a topic you’re interested in, you won’t see it unless they’re your connection or one of your connections has interacted with that post.

The same is true in reverse: no matter how many times you post about your business or industry topics, only your connections will see it.

This does include second and third degree connections, but even then it means there’s a limit to how many new customers you could reach.

That means just posting — even regularly — isn’t the best way to reach potential clients you aren’t already connected with.

That’s where LinkedIn Groups come in.

While you usually have to be connected to someone to message them, you can directly contact members of the same group without being connected. You can also answer group members’ questions and raise your profile within your industry.

## How to Find LinkedIn Groups 

There are two ways to do this: with a search or by viewing the groups LinkedIn recommends for you.

### Method 1: Searching for LinkedIn Groups 

To find groups yourself, go to the search bar at the top of your profile and enter the type of group you’re interested in, for example ‘marketing’.

Hit search and you’ll notice a bar that says ‘People, Jobs, Content, More’. Select ‘More’ and you’ll see a ‘Groups’ option.

Select ‘Groups’ and it will filter all the results for marketing, or whatever topic you picked, to only show you groups rather than people or jobs.

For something as broad as marketing you will get thousands of results, so try and pick a more specific search to narrow in on the people you want to reach.

### Method 2: LinkedIn Group Suggestions

To find groups based on LinkedIn’s suggestions for you, look at the top navigation bar; next to the small image of you, you’ll see the ‘Work’ option.

Under ‘Visit more LinkedIn products’ you’ll see the Groups icon.

Click the Groups icon and LinkedIn will open another tab. If you’re already a member of several Groups, you’ll see popular posts and conversations from that day.

To find more Groups you might like, click ‘Discover’ on the top left to see LinkedIn’s top suggestions for you.

## Can You Join a LinkedIn Group as a Company? 

At the moment, LinkedIn only lets individuals join LinkedIn Groups, not companies. 

If you want to interact with a group, you’ll need to join using your personal LinkedIn profile.

Before applying to join, make sure your LinkedIn profile is not only up-to-date, but engaging and a proper reflection of where you are currently in your career.

## How to Join a LinkedIn Group

The first thing to do is to check it’s the right group for you. Remember: For most groups, you’ll only be able to join if you are actively working in that industry.

To check if the group is right for you, click on the group’s name and take a look at the About section on the right-hand side.

Take a minute to also familiarise yourself with the group rules. Each group will vary, but direct sales pitches are almost always not allowed.

## How to Make the Most of LinkedIn Groups 

First things first: Don’t be that spammy person who joins, writes a post about their business, then never says anything again. No one is going to respond well to that and they’ll probably kick you out of the group.

Think of it like a networking event, just online: start conversations, comment on people’s ideas, and — most importantly — share your expertise.

A good way to interact with a new group is to write an article on an area of interest to that group that you know lots about.

You can then publish it to the group as a ‘conversation’ for people to react to.

If you’re not much of a writer, keep up to date with other conversations posted in the group and add your own input as a comment.

If you haven’t got time to check in on your groups daily, many offer a weekly email round up of key conversations, allowing you to save time and still contribute.
