To engage potential clients, your LinkedIn profile needs to be more than just up to date.

As well as making sure you have the basics covered (recent photo, correct location), your profile should be easy to read, with concise yet engaging copy.

To make sure you’re getting seen by potential leads, your LinkedIn profile also needs to be optimised to help people find you. That means including the right words in the right places on your profile.

LinkedIn do have an assessment tool of their own: [https://www.linkedin.com/sales/ssi](https://www.linkedin.com/sales/ssi "https://www.linkedin.com/sales/ssi").  While it’s a good overall indicator of how you’re using the platform and how you compare to your peers, it’s not great at telling you how to change that score.

Use the matrix below to get an idea of how strong your profile is and which areas need improvement. You’ll find the score evaluation and recommended next steps at the bottom of this article.

Not a great score? Head to our [How to Improve Your LinkedIn Profile](/resource-centre/networking-on-linkedin/improving-your-linkedin-profile/) article which walks you through how to fix all of the below points.

**0–5: Uh oh**

Your profile is pretty unloved right now! If you want to make a good first impression on potential clients, this needs some urgent attention. Start at the top of the matrix and work your way down to make sure you have all basics fixed first.

**6–10: Lots to improve**

Maybe you haven’t been very active on LinkedIn in the past, but if you’re thinking about taking the leap to run your own business, you can’t afford to overlook this professional networking giant. Invest a little time in getting your profile up to scratch.

**11–17: Getting there**

You’ve got the basics covered, but you’re not really making the most of LinkedIn as a tool to grow your business and engage potential clients. To take your LinkedIn profile to the next level, take a look at our our [How to Improve Your LinkedIn Profile](/resource-centre/networking-on-linkedin/improving-your-linkedin-profile/) article to fill in the gaps you’ve identified.

Your profile is in great shape — nice! Remember, LinkedIn isn’t a static platform — it’s a social network. Increase your visibility and attract potential customers with regular posts in groups and on your profile. Our [LinkedIn Groups](/resource-centre/networking-on-linkedin/linkedin-groups/) article is a great place to start.
