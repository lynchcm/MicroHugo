To engage potential clients, your LinkedIn profile needs to be more than just up to date.

As well as making sure you have the basics covered (recent photo, correct location), your profile should be easy to read, with concise yet engaging copy.

To make sure you’re getting seen by potential leads, your LinkedIn profile also needs to be optimised to help people find you when searching for the services you offer. That means including the right words in the right places on your profile.

LinkedIn do have an assessment tool of their own: [https://www.linkedin.com/sales/ssi](https://www.linkedin.com/sales/ssi "https://www.linkedin.com/sales/ssi").  While it’s a good overall indicator of how you’re using the platform and how you compare to your peers, it’s not great at telling you how to change that score.
