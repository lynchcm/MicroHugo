When you’re starting your own business, your existing network can be an incredibly valuable source of clients or even just information and support.

LinkedIn makes it easy to stay in touch with contacts from previous jobs, but not if you treat it like a static digital CV.

### 1) Make sure network changes are turned off before making little edits

Though you might want to notify your network about big job changes, don’t irritate important contacts by forgetting to turn off ‘notify your network of changes’ before making minor edits.

To change your settings, follow these steps:

* Click on the small icon of your profile picture
* Select ‘Settings & Privacy’ from the dropdown menu
* Click the privacy tab
* Scroll down to ‘How others see your LinkedIn activity’
* Change the ‘Share profile edits’ option to ‘no’

## 2) Create an engaging LinkedIn tagline that’s different to your job description

![](/uploads/linkedin3.png)

By default, LinkedIn will fill your tagline with your current job title — don’t leave it that way!

LinkedIn runs on some pretty simple search algorithms. You need the right key words and plenty of them in your profile to get found. Unlike with Google, think quantity over quality!

If you leave it as your current job description, you might be missing out opportunities. This is even more true once you run your own business — you want people to be able to find you based on the skills they need and you can help with.

## 3) Be proactive about adding connections

Have you got less than 200 connections? If the answer is yes, you need to take a more proactive approach to networking on LinkedIn.

Why? That simple algorithm we mentioned before comes into play again here. No matter how many times you post about your business or industry topics, only your connections will see it.

This does include second and third degree connections, but even then it means there’s a limit to how many people you can reach.

The more people you’re connected with, the more people will see your content and profile. If only Google were still that easy!

## 4) Complete some of the optional profile sections

There are six optional sections that you can add to your LinkedIn profile:

* Languages
* Awards
* Certifications
* Publications
* Volunteering
* Patents

You don’t need to complete them all, but aim to have at least three on your profile. The more content LinkedIn has to judge your profile by, the more likely you are to appear in related searches.

## 5) Check you have the right ‘Open to recruiters’ settings

This is a fairly new feature where you can signal to recruiters that you’re looking for new opportunities.

On your profile, you’ll see it in the My Dashboard area:

![](/uploads/linkedin4.png)

You can also navigate straight to it: [https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/career-interests/](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/career-interests/ "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/career-interests/")

Don’t dismiss this setting just because you’re freelancing or consulting: as well as selecting if you’re generally open to opportunities, you can also specify the type of opportunity, including contract, remote, and temporary.

Two caveats: Firstly not all recruiters can see these settings; LinkedIn made it a super premium feature that’s only available to their most expensive recruiter accounts.

Secondly, LinkedIn don’t guarantee that your current employer won’t see that you’re looking for new stuff or planning to go freelance, so approach with caution if you’re still employed.

## 6) Choose which parts of your profile are publicly visible

You can now choose exactly which parts of your profile are visible only to contacts, your network, or the general public.

If you’re trying to raise the profile of your new business, you might want to make more of these publicly visible.

To check your current visibility settings or make changes, look on the top right-hand side of your profile and you’ll see ‘Edit public profile & URL’.

You’ll then see the ‘Edit Visibility’ settings on the right.

# 7) Join groups

According to LinkedIn, Groups are “a place for professionals in the same industry or with similar interests to share content, find answers, post and view jobs, make business contacts, and establish themselves as industry experts.”

Once your part of a group, you can message others within the group without being connected to them.

Answering questions and contributing to group discussions is a great way to raise your profile as an industry expert.

For more on why LinkedIn Groups matter, how to join and make the most of them, read our [What Are LinkedIn Groups](/resource-centre/networking-on-linkedin/linkedin-groups/) article.

## 8) Nail your profile picture

Be honest: Did you crop someone out of your profile picture? Is it from a meal out or wedding? Or do you also use it for an online dating profile?

If any of these apply or it’s more than two years old, it’s time to get a new picture. People might be trying to get in touch after a networking event, and if you’re picture doesn’t look like you anymore, you might miss an opportunity.

You can also do a kind of image search on Google where you ask it to find any other places that picture is used. If you don't want potential clients reading your dating profile, make sure  you use different pictures. 

Get someone to help you take a better one in good lighting and wearing whatever type of clothes you’d usually wear to work - no need for the suit and tie if you're in an industry that's smart casual or casual. 

## 9) Set a cover photo

As well as your profile picture, you can now also add a background image as a cover picture. It’s a good way to show you care about your online profile and have made the extra effort.

A word of warning: though the cover pictures are nice and large when viewed on a computer, they’re tiny on mobile and your profile picture will cover the header in different places depending on the screen size.

## 10) Select skills and get endorsements 

In the ‘Featured Skills & Endorsements’ section you can list up to a whopping 50 skills.

Don’t do that though: pick the ones that are the best fit with your business that you want to be known for.

That way you’re more likely to be endorsed for the skills that matter to you.

Pick around 10-15 and readily endorse others in the hope they’ll reciprocate.

## 11) Complete the contact information section

This is a great way to include a link to your freelance portfolio or company website, as well as more direct contact details like an email address.

To add your contact information to your LinkedIn profile, start on your profile and select ‘See contact info’.

![](/uploads/linkedin5.png)

A pop-up window will then open where you can add several websites and additional email addresses.

## 12) Add a list of skills to your summary

Remember: The LinkedIn algorithm is really simple. That means it will use the words in your profile to decide whether to show you in search results.

Write a concise, engaging summary, then at the end, add a list of skills. This will help ensure more people who are looking for the services you offer see your profile.

## 13) Write bespoke content for your job descriptions

Hold your hands up: Have you copy and pasted any part of your experience section from the job description or company website? If so, scrap it and start again.

There are several reasons this is a bad approach. You want your experiences to tell a coherent story that matches where you want to be. This means tailoring your profile to match your career goals. To do that, it needs to read like one coherent document.

The change of tone and style when something is pasted in not only means your profile lacks some of that readability, but it sends a message to potential employers and clients that you’re a little bit lazy. Not a great first impression!

## 14) Keep descriptions concise and focused on key messages

Copy each of your experience section descriptions into an online word count tool ([http://www.charactercountonline.com/](http://www.charactercountonline.com/ "http://www.charactercountonline.com/")) and see what they come to.

They should all be roughly the same length and around 50 words is a good length for recruiters and clients who will be skimming your profile.

This might sound short, but they’re just getting to know you at this point. Pique their interest and give them a clear link to your website to find out more.

## 15) Cut the buzzwords

“A highly motivated, driven individual that’s results oriented… blah blah blah” — if your summary or experience section is packed full of cliches, buzzwords, and jargon, nobody will take the time to read your profile.

Why would they? They already know what it says: the same as loads of other people. Jargon shows a lack of imagination and makes it harder to stand out from the crowd.

Write in a way that reflects who you are, the industry you work in, and the clients you’re trying to attract.

## 16) Add images or links to job descriptions

Images really help break up the text and add interest to your profile.

You can do this either by uploading an image file or pasting a link to a relevant article or image; LinkedIn will then pull in the matching picture.

It doesn’t just have to be pictures: you can upload or link to videos, presentations, websites or documents.

To add an image or link, click the pencil icon to edit the job description. Scroll right to the bottom and you’ll see the Media option.

## 17) Ask for recommendations

It can feel a bit forward asking people you’ve worked with to write a recommendation, but it’s a good way to show that people rate you and enjoyed working with you.

If you don’t feel comfortable approaching your current or previous managers, think about colleagues in the same team that would be able to recommend you. They’ll be able to specify their working relationship with you when giving the reference.

## 18) Change to a custom URL

This sounds tricky, but is actually really easy.

Rather than the URL (web address) of your profile being your name and a long string of random numbers, e.g. www.linkedin.com/in/yourname-243785938, you can edit it to just your name (perhaps with an initial if there are lots of people with your name).

The result is something that’s shorter and easier to remember, like ‘www.linkedin.com/in/yourname’, making it easier to include on business cards, CVs, or proposals.

## 19) Remove the ‘People also viewed’ section

The ‘People also viewed’ section might seem harmless, but actually it could be presenting a potential client with other people to contact instead.

Luckily, it’s optional. To remove it:

* Click on your mini profile picture in the top right
* Select ‘Settings & privacy’ from the dropdown menu
* Choose the privacy tab
* Toggle off the ‘Viewers of this profile also viewed’ section (it’s the fourth one down)

## 20) Comment on other people’s posts

Now that you have an all-star profile, it’s time to make the most of LinkedIn by interacting with people.

The easiest way to get started on this is by commenting on things your contacts have shared. Try to add something to the conversation rather than ‘Great post John’ or ‘I agree, Sara’.

See if there’s another article you could link to or share your personal experience of the subject.

## 21) Share your own post

Sharing doesn’t have to mean baring your soul in a blog-style post; it could be an industry-relevant article or an achievement.

Start small by looking for articles that potential clients would find interesting and sharing those.

To maximise the number of people who see it, include a hashtag or two. They were introduced on LinkedIn not too long ago and can be a useful way to join conversations.

Tip: In general, hashtags on LinkedIn tend to be quite specific rather than the endless list of broadbrush hashtags that you see on Instagram posts. For ideas, take a look at the second part of this article: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hashtags-linkedin-directory-list-who-what-where-when-how-amy-jones/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hashtags-linkedin-directory-list-who-what-where-when-how-amy-jones/ "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hashtags-linkedin-directory-list-who-what-where-when-how-amy-jones/")

If you’re up for an additional challenge, write a whole article. When you select the ‘Write an article’ option, it’ll take you to the LinkedIn publisher page. Once you’ve hit publish, it’ll be part of Pulse, LinkedIn’s content hub and may appear on people’s walls.
