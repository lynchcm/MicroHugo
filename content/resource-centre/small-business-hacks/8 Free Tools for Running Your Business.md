What's the biggest change when you start freelancing or running your own business? You're responsible for everything.

Whether you were an expert in finance or making furniture before, now you're responsible for every piece of your business.

It can be really daunting. But luckily there are plenty of tools out there that can automate, simplify, or keep track of those little things and make running your own business that little bit easier.

We have tried and tested each one of these tools ourselves and use them every day to run our businesses. Introducing them could help you save time and focus on doing the things that you enjoy and that bring in money.

## Toggl

What takes up the majority of your time? How long do you spend replying to emails? If you work from home, how long do you spend doing the washing, cooking, or on your phone?

There's a rule in business that says 20% of what you spend your time on delivers 80% of the value.  But if you're not tracking your time, how do you know what that 20% is? Or whether your business is really making enough profit?

Toggl is a time tracking tool. It helps you see exactly what you're spending your time on,  broken down by project and client.

You can use it to generate invoices for clients or just keep track of how long is spending on each task allowing you to evaluate what activities are adding value.

It’s a great way to evaluate objectively which tasks take longest and how much time your business is taking up overall. 

## Trello

From shared notes to lists on a whiteboard, we've tried many different ways of tracking our tasks as a business.

Though there are many different techniques and apps for keeping track of all those little things to do, Trello is the one that's really stood out for us.

Based on a kanban-board-style system, it has its fair share of disciples who all have their own ways of using it. And that's the good thing about it: you can organise your lists in the way that suits you best.

We have just one work board with three different columns that divide tasks by urgency. Others choose to have a board for each different project they're running — you can use the method that suits you best.

One of my favourite features is that you can snooze items on your to-do list. They then pop back up at the time you set, avoiding your to-do list getting cluttered with items that you can't yet complete.

## Zoom

Zoom is a kind of fancier, more modern version of Skype.  It uses a reliable internet connection to call and video call over the internet.

Our favourite feature is that you can easily share your screen with other participants on a call.  We use this feature a lot when walking people through social media techniques or discussing feedback on their website.

You can invite people to a meeting using either a code or an email and it gives your meeting invites a really professional look and feel.

## Buffer

Buffer is an absolute lifesaver when it comes to social media. You can connect up to three of your social media accounts for free, schedule up to 10 posts in advance, and buffer will then send them out at the time that you’ve scheduled.

It's no substitute for interacting with people directly on Twitter and Facebook, but it does mean you can post consistently without it taking up too much time during your working week.

If you're looking to get started with buffer, take a look at our social media package. 

## Canva

Speaking of social media, Canva is a must-have for creating great looking graphics and posts for your different social media platforms.

Disclaimer: Though we started with the free version, we found that we were using it so much we upgraded to the premium version for additional features which is a pretty reasonable £11 a month.

Still, the free version offers lots of functionality including templates and pre-sized graphics for many social media platforms —  no need to keep looking up exactly what image size you need for Facebook or Twitter.

It's worth mentioning that Google drawings is also pretty good, though a little less user-friendly and no templates for inspiration. 

## HubSpot CRM

[_hubspot.com_](https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm)

As well as having some pretty great free training available on their website, HubSpot also offer a free basic version of their CRM platform.

What's great about it is that it integrates with Gmail and other email providers to keep track of different interactions with potential customers and clients.

It's also web based, so you can login from whatever machine or device you're using if you're working remotely.

## PayPal

[_PayPal.com_](https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/email-invoice)

One of the most exciting moments as a freelancer or small business is completing a project for your clients and getting paid!

To do that, you'll need to send out an invoice. One of the quickest and simplest ways to do that is through your PayPal account.

Set up a dedicated account for your company, and on the homepage you'll see a create invoice option. Click there to pick from their free customisable templates and generate your invoice.

## Mailchimp 

[_mailchimp.com_](https://mailchimp.com/)

Founded in 2001, there's a reason MailChimp has been around so long: it's great at what it does.

If you're planning to send out a regular newsletter or email marketing campaigns, it's a great way to track who you've sent them too, who's opened them, and the click-through rate.

Though it's not completely customisable, there are many different template options for you to change how your email looks and create an engaging campaign that will get opened.
