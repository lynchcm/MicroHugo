If you're trying to win over someone you haven't worked with before, it can be the little things that make all the difference.

These five things will help you create a good first impression and build on that in order to seal the deal.

We're going to assume that you have a website, but if not that should be step one — get in touch!

## Use a Professional Email Address

When you work for yourself, it’s easy for the line between your personal and professional life to get blurred. This should definitely not be the case with your inbox.

As well as creating the impression that this is more of a hobby than a business, when emails from prospective clients are bundled in with ones about online shopping and the millions of newsletters you’re subscribed, you’re bound to overlook one.

Getting your own professional email address with a custom domain that uses your company name is really quick and cheap.

[G-suite](https://gsuite.google.co.uk/intl/en_uk/) is the one we use and recommend. If you already have a domain, it’ll cost just over £3 per month to get a ‘name@businessname’ style email address and 30GB of storage.

## Set Up Your Email Signature 

While we’re talking about email, another little thing that can make a big difference is setting up your email footer.

As well as additional contact information such as your phone number, include your company name, registered company number, website, and logo.

If applicable, you could also use this space to mention special offers or link to new content on your website. 

## Make a Company LinkedIn Page 

It’s quick and easy to set up a company LinkedIn page. What’s great is that once it’s set up, instead of just putting ‘freelance’ for your current company and having a greyed out picture, you’ll be able to select your actual company name and the logo will appear.

To make a company LinkedIn page, log in and select the small icon of your face in the top right. Look towards the bottom of the dropdown menu and you’ll see the create company page option.

Before you get started, one weird quirk of company pages is that you can’t save a draft, you can only publish. Make sure you draft any content you’ll need to think about, like your company description, in advance and allow enough time to complete your company page in one sitting.

If you need a bit of extra support getting it up and running, read this [LinkedIn help article](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/710/creating-a-linkedin-company-page?lang=en).

## Get Business Cards (and Carry Them with You!)

There’s a reason why business cards are still around — they’re useful! There will be times (hopefully many) when what you do comes up in conversation and someone expresses an interest.

Business cards are a good way to capitalise on that interest without seeming overly desperate by getting your phone out and asking for their number or email.

Done well, they can be more than just basic information, they can showcase your businesses style and personality.

You can get square ones, ones with rounded corners, cotton ones — you name it. Invest in a great design and quality cards and make sure you always have a few with you.

If you want something fancy, check out [moo.com](https://www.moo.com/uk/products/business-cards.html) — it’s like a mini art exhibition. If you’re more budget conscious, [Banana Print](https://www.banana-print.co.uk/) are a good choice, but avoid [Solopress](https://www.solopress.com/) (they mashed our logo and sent very flimsy cards with weirdly sharp corners).

## Create a Cover for Documents

Take inspiration from the fancy brochures that used to be the go-to for impressing potential clients and give it a modern twist with a digital front cover for your documents. 

It could be as simple as a logo and your company name on a cover sheet, or you could get more creative with free online graphic design software like [Canva](https://www.canva.com/).
