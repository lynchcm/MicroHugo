One of the biggest mistakes freelancers and small businesses make is being too broad with their business offering. 

If you’ve been in your industry long enough to go freelance, it’s likely you’ve covered a wide range of areas. But that doesn’t mean your consultancy services should be equally broad. 

Equally, the main, if not the only, way small new businesses can compete with established giants is by being experts in their area.

As soon as you’re an expert, you’re offering something they can’t get from big businesses. You’ll become their go-to person for that area and secure repeat business — the key to making your own business work.

But how do you know what one or two things you should focus on? 

If you take only one thing away from this article it should be this: make sure your business focuses on what you can do quicker and better than other people. 

Don’t just pick what you’re better at. Picking the thing you can also do quicker means you’ll deliver more value for your clients and it’ll take you less time and effort to do so. 

If you don’t instinctively know what that is, use the steps below to help you narrow down your business to your real area of expertise.

## Step 1: Brain Dump 

Grab a blank piece of paper and write down all the things you have experience in. 

At this stage, it doesn’t really matter if you’ve only touched on them or you do them every day. 

## Step 2: Filter 

Looking at all the things on the paper, identify and circle the eight to ten things you have done the most. 

It doesn’t matter if you have less than eight, but don’t go over this number.

## Step 3: Matrix 

Now it’s time to whittle them down using a matrix that takes into account your skill level, speed, enjoyment, and value added. 

Using the table provided (download), rank each factor from one to five: one is ‘I’m not that great at this/ I don’t like it very much/ it doesn’t bring much value to companies’, and five being ‘I’m a rock star at this’. 

Be careful with the speed column: you’re evaluating how much quicker you can do that particular task than your peers, not how long that task takes to complete. 

For example, for writing a book might be a time consuming task, but if it’s your 15th best seller and you know you can plan and type really quickly, you’d rank yourself as a 5 as you know you can deliver much quicker than a rookie author. 

Here’s an example based on a Marketing Consultant:

From this we can see that strong areas for this consultant to focus on would be launch event planning, closely followed by marketing planning.

## Step 4: Qualify the Demand 

As you start to hone in on your area, it’s time to do a bit of market research. 

For each service you have left, make a list of the types of clients or customers that would be interested in it. 

Which has the most demand? Which list would be easiest to find and win over? 

On top of that, you need to take into account competition. 

If your business is location specific, start by checking how many people near you are offering each service. 

If you’re not finding much, the lack of competition could be a great sign. On the other hand, it could mean there’s not enough business to sustain what you’re offering. 

Test which it is by seeing how many of the potential clients you listed are in the area you’re looking at. 

If your service is not location specific, you’ll have to do a bit more research. Aim to get an overall feel of how many people are fighting for business. 

One good way to get an idea of this is with Google AdWords. Sign up for an AdWords account — it’s free — and head to the [keyword planner](https://ads.google.com/intl/en_uk/home/tools/keyword-planner/). 

Put in things people might search for when they’re looking for your potential services and it’ll give you an idea of how much it would cost per click to bid on that particular search term. 

If you see something between £0.66 and £1.32 then it’s a good sign — there’s an average level of competition in your area. 

Below that, it can be a good sign, but do a double check whether you think there’s enough of your potential clients you listed. 

Above that, it’s not necessarily the end of the idea, but you may need to be even more specific with what you offer in order to get business. 

For example, if our marketing consultant found out lots of people were offering launch event planning, they might decide to specialise in tech events. 

## Step 5: Sense Check 

After qualifying the demand and getting an idea for how much competition there is, one of the services should stand out to you. 

If it does, that’s great — imagine introducing yourself to former colleagues, friends and potential clients. Does it feel like the right fit? Sleep on it, and if the answer is still yes, you’re ready to go!

If one doesn’t stand out more than the other, go back to the matrix and check which one of the two you gave the higher enjoyment score to. That’s the one to go with. 

Running your own business means finding a reserves of energy, patience, and determination you never knew you had. The more passion you have for what you’re doing, the easier that will be.
