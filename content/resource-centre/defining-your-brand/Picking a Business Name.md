If you’ve decided to bite the bullet and go freelance or set up your own business, one of the first things you’ll need to decide is what to call yourself.

When registering as a company, you’ll need to state what you want your company’s registered name to be.

But it can be so tough picking one or two words to sum up your business. Here are some tips and ideas on how to pin down the perfect name.

If you’re really struggling, keep in mind that it’s not actually that hard to change your name after you’ve registered: you complete an online form, it costs about £8, and you’re done, so don’t worry too much about picking the wrong business name.

## Legal Requirements for Naming Your Business

There are a different rules about what names you can have depending on what type of company you’re registering as.

If you’re a sole trader, having an official business name is optional; you can just use your given name.

Keep in mind that you can’t use terms like ‘Limited’, ‘Ltd’, or ‘plc’ if you’re a sole trader.

If you’re a private limited company, you must choose a name that’s unique to your business. Names that are too similar to other companies won’t be allowed.

For example, Companies House states: ‘Hands UK Ltd’ and ‘Hand’s Ltd’ are the same as ‘Hands Ltd’.

For a full list of the rules for naming a limited company, take a look at the GOV.UK [advice page](https://www.gov.uk/limited-company-formation/choose-company-name).

## Think Practical: Checking Business Name Availability

It doesn’t matter how much you love a particular name, if someone has already registered it, you need to go back to the drawing board.

If you’re UK based, you’ll need the Companies House [name availability checker](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company-name-availability) open to do a quick check on any ideas before you get too attached to them.

But it’s not just whether it’s legally available that matters: you’ll want to check if the domain is available too. It’s no use having registered the perfect name if you can’t get the website address to match.

As well as the [name availability checker](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company-name-availability), have a domain registrar like GoDaddy open in the next window.
