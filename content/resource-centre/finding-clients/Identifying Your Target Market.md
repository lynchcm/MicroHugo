Before you send a single email, inMessage or make a phone call, you need to have an idea of what kind of customers you’re looking for.

Identifying your target market isn’t marketing fluff; it’s essential to making sure you focus your efforts on the people that are most likely to become clients.

Thinking this through in detail will help you decide on the right approach, style, and offer that will be useful and engaging for prospective clients. 

## Refining Your Offer

In an earlier article, we talked about making sure you’ve really narrowed down what you’re offering to a specific niche, taking into account the golden rule: focus on what you can do better and quicker than anyone else.

If your services are still pretty broad, it’s worth taking a few minutes to go back and read our section on How to Refine Your Business Proposition so that you’re ready to identify your target market. 

## The Problem/Solution Approach

The first question to ask yourself when you're trying to define your target audience is what problem does my business solve? Depending on the service you offer, this could be one problem or many.

After you've made a list of the problems your service solves, think about the people that are experiencing those issues.

Are these problems common in certain industries? Or is there a particular type of business that experiences this issue?

For each problem, make a list of people who are experiencing it. Try to be as specific as possible.

Looking at that list, are there certain types of people that come up again and again? Or is there really strong, urgent demand from one particular group?

Pick the two or three that stand out the most to you and move on to the next step. 

## Create Buyer Personas 

People often skip this, but it doesn't have to be time consuming and can really add value by prioritising who to target.

Taking the two or three potential clients you identified in the above step, turn them into semi-fictitious characters with a description of who they are, how old they are, where they work, and the problem they’re experiencing that you could help with.

As well as demographics, think about behavioural things like their buying habits, attitudes, and opinions.

Give them names and imagine what they look like. Draw them if you want — whatever it takes to bring them to life and make them stick in your memory.

Visualising potential clients in this way will help you think about where to find these people and how best to approach them.

You’ll be able to tailor your selling process not only to your target market, but to the specific persona or segment within it.

## Sense Check

So far we've only checked that this potential buyer has a need for your service. We also need to take into account what kind of client they would be for you and whether they can afford your service.

For example, you might have decades of experience helping companies nail their branding. Many startups would definitely want this service, but few could afford to pay top rates for it.

Take a few moments to think through whether each of these buyer personas has the authority to hire you and the budget to pay you.
