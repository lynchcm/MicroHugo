Finding clients is one of the hardest things about starting your own business. One of the oldest sales techniques, Networking is a great way for you to show how helpful you and your business can be to potential client.

It used to be that networking was only done face to face, but with the rise of professional networking platforms and Online forums, It's easier than ever to network without even leaving your home.

Whether it's in person or online, Make sure you don't see networking as an opportunity to pounce on you clients and shove your business in their face. Leave the hard sell in the 90s.

Instead, see networking as a chance to get to know potential clients and find out how you can help them.

The best case? You'll find yourself a new client. But even if they're not ready to work with you yet, the relationship you’ve already built up means you’ll be the first one they’ll turn to when they do have a need for your service.

## Face-to-Face Networking

Before you head out to networking event, make sure you have a few essentials: plenty of business cards, a pen in case you need to take down anyone else’s details and they don’t have a card, and your website open on your phone so you could quickly show someone if needed.  

### Meetup

Meetup is a great way to search for events happening near you by topic.

Pick your city and the topic you're interested in, for example entrepreneurship or business networking, and a selection of groups with events happening nearby will pop up.

### University business schools

Business schools often host talks and lectures by guest speakers that are open to the general public as well as their students.

Keep an eye on upcoming events by following the University on Facebook or subscribing to their mailing list.

If you see a topic that you know what appeal to your target audience, make the time to go along.

### Alumni events

Your own university or business school can also be a good source of networking opportunities.

Alumni events may conjure up images of an old boys club, sipping whiskey in a wood panelled room, but most universities now take a much more modern approach to engaging their alumni.

Many universities will also have an alumni newsletter. This can be a great way to get your message out to a wider audience of people. 

### Conferences & Trade Shows

No matter what your industry, you're likely to find a conference or trade show that is of interest to you and your potential clients.

Think back to your buyer personas and the types of events you're most likely to find them at.

Industry publications and blogs are a great way to find out about that coming shows, and you could also look at what’s coming up at popular venues like the NEC. 

### Community Events

If you mostly work with local clients, keep an eye out for upcoming events in your community that will give you a chance to meet more people.

Charity fundraising events, sports matches, and even social events like seeing a local band can be a great opportunity to introduce yourself to people.

Even if you're not talking to someone who could be a client themselves, they may know someone who would be interested in your service and be able to recommend you when the time comes.

Remember to match your tone and approach to the occasion. This is not the time for a hard sell, this is a chance to be helpful to people and raise awareness of a local solution to a problem they may have.

## Online Networking

It’s brilliant that we can now stay connected so easily, but there’s a flipside to online networking too: everything you say and do is visible and attributable to you.

Make sure you remain professional and create separate social media accounts for business use that aren’t linked to your personal account.

Make sure your picture is up-to-date and professional, not something you cropped a friend out of or took on holiday several years ago!

On a practical note, try and get the same username on each platform to help potential clients remember you and find you on whichever platforms they use.

Even if you don’t intend to use a particular social media platform for your business, register the name so there’s no potential confusion and competitors can’t get hold of it.

### LinkedIn

When you think of online networking, it's likely that LinkedIn is the first platform that comes to mind.

It's not enough just to have a profile, you need to be active on LinkedIn. This means sharing stories you find interesting, commenting on other people's posts, and joining group discussions.

Make sure you also join industry relevant groups. LinkedIn groups are a place for people in the same industry to discuss challenges, post jobs, and establish themselves as an expert in their field.

Once you're a member of a group, you can also reach out to other group members without necessarily being connected with them.

If you’re not sure how to get started, take a look at our article on how to get started with LinkedIn Groups.

### Reddit

Reddit is a bit like Marmite — you either love it or you hate it.

The self-titled ‘front page of the internet’ is an online discussion platform that has been going for about 13 years and prides itself on being the home of debate on the internet. It can also be lighthearted and has its fair share of memes and cat videos.

From a networking perspective it's useful as you can follow and contribute to subreddits which are based around particular topics.

Engaging with Reddit users and answering their questions is a good way to stand out online without spending a penny.

### Quora

[_quora.com_](https://www.quora.com/)

While Reddit is more discursive, Quora is all about answering questions.

Unlike Reddit where many users have a pseudonym, Quora users complete a full profile including areas of expertise and professional title.

When you answer someone's question in a thread, your picture and the first 50 characters of your bio is shown.

If potential clients see your name and face popping up on the multiple threads and helping them with their questions, they're more likely to see you as an expert on the topic and reach out to you.

### Twitter

Believe it or not, Twitter isn't just for power-crazed world leaders looking to share their opinions at 3 am.

It can be a really good, organic way to join discussions about topics you're an expert in and raise your profile. It's even easier now that you can search Twitter by hashtag.

As well as finding conversations about your business area, think who your ideal client follows on Twitter and follow those people too. That way you can share their content and know that it’ll be of interest to your target audience.
