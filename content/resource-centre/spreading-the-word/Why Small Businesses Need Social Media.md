When you’re starting your own business, it can seem like there are a million and one things to think about.

Why would you take time away from finding clients or working on that proposal to mess around on social media?

Time spent on social media is anything but wasted. If you’re thinking it’s a social thing that’s not for businesses, you’re out of touch. It’s a serious growth tool and lead generator that deserves a dedicated proportion of your time.

Not convinced? Here are the ten reasons why small business have to be on social media.

## Level the Playing Field

Let’s assume that like most other new companies, you have no marketing budget. A big TV marketing campaign is pie in the sky and it’s even hard to put aside a few pounds a day for Google ads.

While bigger companies will always be able to spend more on flashy campaigns and outbid you in Google ad auctions, social media depends on quality, not quantity, allowing little companies to compete.

Direct engagement with potential customers for free in a way that allows you to compete with industry giants — what could be better!

## Create a Sales Funnel

Content marketing is one of the most effective marketing strategies out there. Instead of pushing your message at people, you pull them in with helpful articles that give them a positive experience of your brand.

But it’s no use having a great blog with interesting content unless you can make sure it’s seen. That’s where social media comes in. Great content gets circulated, and suddenly your business is in front of lots of people.

## Drive Website Traffic

Theory is fine. But nothing beats having tried something in practice. That’s what we do with everything we recommend.

Micro was formed after struggling to find good, affordable website and branding for our first company, [GenNeu](https://genneu.co.uk/) — a gender neutral ecommerce store.

Social media has been the main way we’ve driven traffic to our online store.

Since launch, almost 50% of our traffic has come from social media. Another 35% has comes to our website directly by typing in the URL, and 12% have found us on Google.

Not only is 50% significant, I’d be willing to bet that a significant number of the people that knew about or searched for our website had heard of us from social media.

That’s how much of an awareness and growth driver social media can be.

## Create a Quick Feedback Loop

Big, fancy market research panels are only affordable for the biggest companies. Luckily, you can road test your ideas in real time with social media.

From actively gauging interest in a particular topic to just watching what generates traffic, you’ll get a much better feel for the market you’re operating in, the people you need to talk to, and the messages that will resonate with them.

If you don’t get a good reaction, social media allows you to pick up on any potential problems early and pivot to something with a better chance of success.

## Explain How You’re Different

Have you noticed how TV adverts have been getting gradually more and more wacky? There’s an incredible amount of competition out there, and it’s getting harder and harder to stand out.

Faced with loads of choice, who do consumers pick? The brands they like. The brands that are doing something a bit more unique. The brands that sound like them and reflect their values.

People are more likely to get all of that from a smaller business — that’s you!

By combining your company’s authentic tone, unique offering, and the approachability of social media, you’ll be able to make your company stand out from the crowd.

## Improve Brand Recall

The advertising industry are always trying to balance reach and recall: they want to reach lots of people, but they also want the same people to see their advert about five times to make sure they remember the brand.

Social media gives you a win on both fronts — without the expensive TV ads! By posting regularly, potential customers will start to not only take notice of but remember your brand.

When they need the service you offer, you’ll be top of mind.

## Intrigue Pre-Purchase Researchers

There’s not many things you buy now that you don’t heavily research before purchasing. Whether it’s a pair of shoes or a potential doctor, you turn to the internet not only for information but for public opinion.

Social media allows you to share additional information that will help potential customers decide whether your service or product is right for them, and also answer any questions (aka doubts) they have in real time before you’re discounted.

## Generate Free Coverage

New businesses always obsess about PR coverage. Want to know a few secrets from many years in the PR industry? Journalists are lazy and press releases are boring.

No ‘We’ve launched!’ press releases get read. It’s not newsworthy. It’s not a topic of public interest.

More often than not, journalists turn to Twitter to source the freshest stories that have a proven level of interest and interaction.

Hashtags like #prrequest or #journorequest are very popular and give you a way to communicate directly with a journalist about a topic you’re an expert on at the exact moment they need that information. That is how small businesses get PR coverage, not press releases.

## Project the Right Image

Choosing not to be on social media says a lot about your company. It’s like inviting someone round to your house for the first time and them arriving with a print-out of a map rather than just using Google Maps.

It’s really likely that your competitors are already on social media. By ignoring social, you’re letting them own that space and potential clients’ attention.

Being active on social media shows you to be an active, energetic modern company — all qualities potential customers value and want to work with.

## Prepare for Paid Advertising

When you do have a bit of spare revenue to put into marketing, a strong social media presence will help improve your return on investment.

You’ll already have an established audience with a low level of awareness that you can build on with ads.

You can also use the retargeting technologies built into many social platforms, like Facebook Pixel, to identify and reach customers that were the most interested in your business, making sure your first paid campaign is a success.
