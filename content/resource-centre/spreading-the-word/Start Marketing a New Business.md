You’ve registered as a company, you've printed your business cards, you've got your website looking beautiful... so where are the customers?

One of the scariest bits of starting a new business comes after taking the plunge — it's knowing what to do in those few weeks after you launch.

It's not talked about much, but after the adrenaline rush of making the decision to go it alone and the excitement of setting up a company, it can seem like a bit of an anticlimax when customers aren't lining up outside your door straight away.

The good news is that it's now easier than ever to let people know that you've arrived. The bad news is it's equally easy for all of your competitors to do the same!

## The Modern Approach to Marketing & Sales

If you're new to marketing or sales, keep in mind that both industries have been undergoing major changes in recent years.

Cold calling people who've never heard of your business — whether it’s an email, LinkedIn message, flier, or actual call —  is definitely out of fashion and unlikely to get good results.

Modern sales and marketing is all about being useful and helpful to your customer. It's about drawing them into your business with helpful articles or tools that they can use, rather than pushing your message at them. Think pull not push.

Not convinced? Think of the companies that you respond to best. How did you come across them?

If you scroll past the Google ads to find the organic results underneath or you ignore flashy banner ads on websites in favour of well-written, helpful content then you know how much more effective these modern techniques are.

We’ve outlined some of the main ways you can spread the word about your message in a way that will engage rather than annoy potential customers.

We also recommend checking out the HubSpot inbound marketing and sales courses. They're a great introduction to the inbound technique and will give you a good grounding in the topic.

## It's a Process

When people think about marketing they tend to think about one idea in isolation. For example, sending out flyers to people in their building or messaging contacts they think might be interested in their business on LinkedIn.

While there's nothing wrong with leveraging your network, it will be more effective if it's done as part of a multi stage strategy:

1. Create awareness
2. Give away something useful
3. Directly engage

This approach does need you to have a solid idea of your ideal customer, so if you’re still working that out, head to our article on [Identifying Your Target Audience](/resource-centre/finding-clients/identifying-your-target-market/).

### 1) Create Awareness

Before you can approach someone and ask them to buy your product or services, you need them to have heard of you.

Think about the last time you got a spammy LinkedIn message or ‘HI I MAKE GREAT WEBSITES’ comment on social media, did you respond well to it?

There are a number of less direct ways to make someone aware you exist. To do this well, you need to be in the same place as your potential clients — both online and offline.

Social media is a great awareness tool, and because it’s free, it’s great for startups. It’s the main way we grew our ecommerce store, gaining 400 followers that regularly interacted with us in the first 100 days.

By sharing well-picked content regularly with suitable hashtags, you’ll have popped up in potential customers’ feeds at least once.

The next time they see you, they have a vague recall that they’ve seen you somewhere before, and you’re instantly more trustworthy. As well as proactively posting, like and react to things they’ve shared.

Think also about where prospective clients are physically. Are there industry or alumni events you could attend? Could local events be a good way to meet clients if your business is in a particular area?

Take a look at our [article on networking](/resource-centre/finding-clients/networking-ideas/) for more ideas on places to meet potential clients both online and offline

Ideas for creating awareness:

* Post regularly on social media
* Comment on other people’s posts on social media
* Seek out industry events and conferences
* Attend alumni events
* Identify suitable social occasions like meetups

### 2) Give Away Something Useful

Before you say “I’ve got no budget”, this doesn’t have to cost money.

For example, right now we’re giving away some of our top business tips for engaging new clients. That’s why you’re here!

It hasn’t cost us any money to produce these articles as such, just time, but the helpful information has brought you to our website and we hope that makes you want to stick around, read more, and remember who we are if you do need our services.

The same is true for any business. Think of all the peripheral topics that your prospective clients could be interested in and start writing. If you’re short on ideas, try [answerthepublic.com](https://answerthepublic.com/) which generates ideas on a topic in graphical format.

If you’re not a natural writer, think about doing something in person: organise a Q&A session at a local hall (they usually cost £5-10 an hour); offer to be on the panel at an industry event; start a Twitter chat on a topic you’re an expert in.

By sharing your expertise and knowledge with prospective clients for free it creates familiarity and reduces the sense of risk they might feel when working with someone new.

Low-cost giveaway ideas:

* Write helpful articles
* Write guest posts for industry publications
* Start a regular Twitter chat on an industry topic
* Organise a small business Q&A session at a local venue
* Offer a short trial session

### 3) Directly Engage

Now that your potential client has heard your name and got something useful from you, it’s a good time to approach them more directly about your business offering.

But don’t ruin your all your groundwork by copy and pasting a mass message or email; do a bit of homework first.

Hone in on people you think have the best chance of becoming paying clients — go back to your target audience if you need to.

Do some research on what they do, look at their website, read their social media posts and find a good reason to get in touch.

It could be that they’ve interacted with one of your social media posts or there’s something going on at their company that you know your business could help with.

If you’re struggling to find a reason to approach them, go back to the articles you’ve written. Get in touch and say you thought it could be of interest.

You could also use LinkedIn to see if you have mutual connections and use that as an opener.

Whichever you choose, make sure your approach is specific and personal.

Keep track of the people you’re approaching, with details of when you got in touch and what you said; you could do this with a simple spreadsheet, but [HubSpot also offer a free Customer Relationship Management](https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm) (CRM) system that integrates with your email.

Ideas for directly engaging customers:

* Take a look at what they’ve shared on social media and get in touch to share your thoughts or perspective
* Investigate events happening at their company that you could help with
* Directly send them an article you’ve written that could be useful to them
* Check for mutual connections
