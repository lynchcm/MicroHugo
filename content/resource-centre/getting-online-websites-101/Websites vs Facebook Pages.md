With all the work getting your business off the ground and running it on a day-to-day basis, making a website might slip to the bottom of the list or get ruled out for being too expensive.

After all, why pay for a website when having a Facebook page is free? Well, there’s more to it. Here are just a few of the reasons why having your own website can really help you small business establish a strong online presence and reach more customers.

## **1) Get found on Google**

When people search for information on a particular topic, Google uses the words on a website to assess whether or not to show that page to the searcher.

It crawls websites for key terms that people have searched for and the better the match, the higher up the ranking the site will show.

It also makes a judgement on how much authoritative that website is on a particular topic, using information such as links to and from other sites. 

Without a website, Google doesn’t have any of this information about your business. People right down the street from your cafe could be searching for ‘coffee shop’ and Google wouldn’t know to suggest your business to them.

Having a Google My Business listing will help with this if people are using Google Maps, but to reach new customers by getting found in Google searches, having a website is essential.

## **2) You’re in control, not Facebook**

You might be pretty happy with your business’s Facebook page at the moment, but what if you woke up tomorrow morning and Facebook had changed the format of the business pages? Or they suddenly made businesses pay to have a page? Or they restricted what content you could include?

Without your own online presence, you’re entirely at Facebook’s mercy. Any changes they make could have a huge impact on your business and number of customers. The same is true of Etsy, Ebay, and other third party sites.

Having your own website allows you to safeguard your business against changes third party platforms make to their site, rules, and pricing.

## **3) Show your company’s personality** 

Because all Facebook business pages have the same structure, it’s really hard to make your company stand out. After all, it’s Facebook’s branding, not yours.

If you’re in a competitive area or there are other similar businesses locally, your own website can really help you stand out from the crowd.

After all, a website isn’t just about giving people information. It’s the first impression many potential customers will have of your business. It gives them an idea not only of what you do, but of what it would be like to be your customer.

If you make incredible bespoke cakes, you should have a website that’s equally unique. If you’re a fun loving sports coach, a website can let you show how you’re different with bold graphics and interactive elements.

With your own website, you get to choose every aspect, from how it looks to the content you include. It shows your customers what you’re about and helps them remember you.

It also gives you room to grow and include content marketing features such as a blog to help bring people to your site. 

## **4) Facebook is determined to make companies pay**

When business pages on Facebook first started, they were a great way to get your content seen by a wide number of people.

But as Facebook has focused more and more on monetising the platform, they’ve been asking businesses to pay for that publicity.

Because you’ve told Facebook you’re a business when you created the page, it knows you benefit from using their platform. And they want to make you pay for that.

What does this mean in practice? If you haven’t paid to boost your content or paid for an ad, Facebook are showing your content to fewer and fewer people.

Businesses that used to see thousands of views on their posts have seen that fall dramatically until they start paying for ads which many small businesses can't afford.

With more and more focus on stock prices, it’s likely Facebook will continue to monetise the platform by making businesses pay for perks that were once free.

## **5) Reach more people**

Though it may seem like the whole world is on Facebook, that’s not that case. About 44% of the UK’s online population use Facebook daily, and [1 in 5](https://www.statista.com/statistics/553538/predicted-number-of-facebook-users-in-the-united-kingdom-uk/) UK adults that use the internet don’t use Facebook at all.

On top of that, Facebook remains skewed towards a younger demographic. The age bracket with the highest number of Facebook users is people aged 25 to 34. Those age 45 to 54 have the lowest number of Facebook users, though this is growing. 

If you’re relying solely on Facebook to reach new customers, you could be missing out on customers who aren’t so focused on social media.

## **6) A website makes your business appear more established**

When you’re asking people to hand over their money, you need them to believe in you. You need them to think you’re great at what you do and you’re worth the price you’re asking.

When people see that a business is popular and successful, they’re more likely to try it — it’s called social proof, and it’s an incredibly important way of attracting and converting new customers.

Without your own website, people may assume you can’t afford one — maybe you don’t have enough customers to make it worthwhile. This won’t inspire new customers to take a risk on you and make a purchase or use your service.

Having your own website implies that you need one. It implies that you take your business seriously — it’s not something temporary that can be represented by a quick Facebook page, it’s established and thriving. That’s the message you want to send to potential customers.

## **7) More space to tell your story**

We live in a time where people are obsessed with online research. Whether it’s a health problem or finding the perfect present, people spend a lot of time researching online before acting.

The same is true of small businesses: [70-80%](https://www.bluecorona.com/blog/29-small-business-digital-marketing-statistics) of people research a small business online before visiting their store or making a purchase.

The problem with a Facebook page is that you’re limited to just that one page. You can’t preempt consumer concerns or questions with an FAQ section or show off your industry expertise with a blog.

A website allows you to give potential customers much more information about your service that might be the difference between showing a passing interest and making a sale.

## **8) Most of your competitors have one**

More and more businesses are online. It’s gone from being optional to essential if you want to get found and grow your business.

When people are searching for the service you provide, it’s inevitable that your competitors will come up too.

If other companies have a website and you don’t, you’re immediately at a disadvantage: people will go where they can find more information.
