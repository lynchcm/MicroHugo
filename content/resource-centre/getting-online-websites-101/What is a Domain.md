Much like picking your business name, it can be tricky to decide on the right domain for your new website. Not only that, there are lots of other factors to take into account, like cost and availability.

This article walks you through what a domain is, your ownership rights when you buy a domain, and how much you can expect to pay.

## At-a-Glance Summary

* A domain tells search engines where to find the files that make up your website.
* You can’t own a domain outright; the maximum you can buy it for is 10 years, but most renew on an annual basis.
* All domains must be registered with WHOIS; some providers handle this for you.
* Make sure you’re buying a domain from an ICANN-accredited domain registrar.
* Budget £1-2 for the first year, then around £10-15 per year.
* Domains can be moved to another provider, but it usually means some downtime for your site and incurs a small cost.

## What is a Domain?

If your website is your house, your domain is your address. It tells search engines where to look for the files that make up your website.

It’s made up of two parts: the bit before the dot which is unique and created by you and the bit after the dot which is common to many different websites.

This second part of the domain is called a generic top-level domain, or gTLD. Originally only five different types of gTLD, but now there are many different types.

You’ll find anything from ‘.company’, to ‘.life’, ‘.guru’, and ‘.wedding’. Some are intended for certain purposes (e.g. ‘.edu’ for educational institutions), but most are open to everyone.

## What kind of domain should I buy?

The two biggest factors when it comes to buying a domain are the the cost and your personal preference.

The ‘.com’ addresses tend to be the most in demand and the most expensive as they’re well established and give a site a certain level of credibility. Unlike country-specific gTLDs, e.g. ‘.co.uk’ or ‘.fr’, ‘.com’ domains are popular with companies that intend to operate in several countries.

As there are so many more gTLDs available now, it’s worth being flexible about which gTLD you’d like and checking different domain name providers to see which they have available.

Using one of the newer gTLDs gives you an opportunity to be more descriptive or specific about what you’re offering and is often cheaper. For example, .co is now popular with tech companies (which is why we picked it)!

## Do you own a domain forever?

It’s not possible to purchase a domain outright or own it forever. Purchasing a domain is similar to renting a flat: you don’t own it and there are ongoing costs associated with using it.

You can choose how often you renew your domain registration. Most domain providers do this on an annual basis but you can pay for more years upfront up to a maximum of ten years to secure a low price.

## Do I have to register my domain? What is WHOIS?

WHOIS is a giant directory of all the domains that exist and who owns them. It lists the domain name as well as details such as when it was created, the server IP addresses, and contact details for the domain owner.

The details you provide need to be correct: WHOIS confirms registrations using the email address provided and giving false details could result in your domain being taken off you.

Take care of your domain registration login details. Losing them can make it very hard to renew your domain and you may risk losing it.

However, if you want to limit how much of your personal information is publicly available, look for a domain provider that includes privacy protection.

## How much is a domain?

Domain registrars usually offer a cheap initial price with a significant price increase in the second year.

Domain prices are often shown excluding tax, so make sure you check whether you’re looking at ex- or inc-VAT prices when comparing different offers.

Another fee to watch out for is the ICANN fees. ICANN charges $0.18 per domain per year as well as for domain transfers and renewals. Though it’s a small amount, it’s worth checking whether your domain provider covers these ICANN fees or not.

## Who should I buy a domain from?

Domains are purchased from certified domain registrars. Only 3,000 of these registrars exist — not many if you consider the size of the internet!

That's because there’s a lot of time, effort, and cost involved in becoming a domain registrar.

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (or ICANN) is a non-profit that’s in charge of the application and accreditation processes for domain registrars.

Before you pick a domain, double check the provider is on the [list of all ICANN accredited registrars](https://www.icann.org/registrar-reports/accredited-list.html).

Reliable, well-known domain providers include sites like [godaddy](https://uk.godaddy.com/), [Domain Discount 24](https://www.domaindiscount24.com/en), and [Google](https://domains.google/#/) now also offer domains.

## Can you move a domain to another provider?

It’s possible to buy a domain from one provider and switch to another provider later. People usually do this when their domain is about to renew (after a year or so) and they’re shopping around for the best price.

There are a few limits in place, for example, you can’t change provider within the first 60 days of purchasing your domain.

Keep in mind that it’s not a quick process. A full registrar transfer process can take 1 to 2 weeks.

There’s sometimes a transfer fee, so check with your provider how much this will be before making a decision on which option is the best value.
