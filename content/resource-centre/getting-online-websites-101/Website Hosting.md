When you start thinking about getting your own website, the number of options and all the jargon can seem a bit overwhelming.

This article walks you through what website hosting is, what to look for when buying it, and how much you can expect to pay.

## At-a-Glance Summary

* Your website is basically a bunch of files. Hosting is where these file are saved.
* Things to look at when picking a hosting service include up time, back up frequency, speed, storage, bandwidth, and SSL certificates.
* Look for 99.9% up time and daily back ups from your hosting provider.
* 1GB of storage and 5GB bandwidth should be enough for most small business websites.

## What is Website Hosting?

Fundamentally an internet page is a file. Just like the files you have on your computer or phone, they need to be saved somewhere. This is what hosting is — where all the files that form your website are saved.

There’s a physical aspect too. Just like your computer has a hard drive where it saves its files, hosting is provided by servers — kind of like massive hard drives.

Every site in the world needs and has hosting — even Google. Bigger companies will usually invest in their own servers to make sure they know exactly how much capacity they have and can always handle the number of people that want to visit their site.

## What to Consider When Buying Website Hosting?

There are many, many different hosting providers, ranging in both price and quality.

The important things to look at when buying website hosting are:

* Up time
* How often it’s backed up
* Speed
* Storage
* Bandwidth
* SSL

### Up time

Up time is a measure of how often that provider’s servers are taken offline for maintenance or if something outside of their control happens, like a power cut, how quickly they manage to get everything working again.

When you’re comparing different hosting providers, look for up time of 99.9% to make sure that people will be able to reliably see your website.

Some providers offer money-back guarantees if your site is down for more than a certain number of hours per month.

### Back ups

Just like you have to make a backup of important files, it would be really risky to use a website host where the files (your website!) aren’t frequently backed up.

Because servers are a physical thing, freak accidents can happen. If that server malfunctions or the warehouse suddenly catches on fire, you want your site to be safely backed up and as recently as possible. Try and find a hosting provider that offers daily back ups.

### Speed

You know how when everyone is at home in the early evening, Netflix can get a little slow or pages take longer to load? A similar thing is true for servers.

With Netflix or home internet browsing, it tends to be your personal internet speed at home that slows things down, but if the servers your hosting provider is using don’t have a fast enough internet connection, your page could take a long time to load.

### Storage

Hosting providers will often have several different plans and prices. More storage space or unlimited storage is often included with premium plans.

So how much storage space do you need for your website? It depends on the content of your site. While words take up very little space, videos and images make pages bigger.

If a hosting provider is offering you 1GB of storage, that’s the equivalent of over 330 average web pages which should be fine for most sites.

### Bandwidth width?

Bandwidth is a measure of the maximum amount of data that can be transferred at any one time.

To figure out how much you need, you have to take into account your average page size, number of pages, and number of monthly visitors to your site (plus 40-50% extra for some wiggle room).

If you want to break it down and figure out exactly how much you’ll need, Jerry Low has written a brilliant [article](https://www.webhostingsecretrevealed.net/blog/web-hosting-guides/how-much-bandwidth-does-your-site-really-need/) on web hosting including all the formulae you’ll need to put an exact figure on it.

If you’re looking for a quick answer, [Hosting Manual](https://www.hostingmanual.net/how-much-bandwidth-and-disk-space-really-need/) found that “99% of websites use no more than 5GB of bandwidth a month”, so use that as a benchmark when comparing hosting providers.

### SSL certificates

SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer. It’s part security, part digital passport that verifies you are who you say you are to people visiting your site. They used to be mainly for ecommerce sites that handled credit card payments, but this has changed.

In February 2018, Google Chrome made changes to the way it handles SSL certificates. If you don’t have them, it will show ‘not secure’ in the browser bar. Google will also continue to penalise sites without the proper security certificates by showing them lower in search results.

We’ll cover SSL certificates in detail in an upcoming post, but in short — whatever your website, whether you take payments or not, you need an SSL certificate. Several hosting providers now offer a free SSL certificate, but if it’s not included, you’ll need to budget around £50 a year.

## How Much Should Website Hosting Cost?

It’s a huge range: from free hosting that puts ads on your site to dedicated hosting with your own servers for all the super sites out there.

The main options are:

* Shared hosting: Multiple websites being hosted on the same server.
* Virtual Private Server (VPS): A handful of websites share the same server, but have greater access to and control over things like the operating system and any apps that are installed.
* Dedicated: Your own servers exclusively for your website

Shared hosting is the most common and affordable option for sites that are just getting started.

Though you can find shared hosting for as little as £1 a month, that tends to mean more websites are packed onto the same server which can cause problems if several sites experience a spike in traffic.

Paying a little extra can help make sure you’re covering the points in the previous section (good up time, frequent back ups, and a fast internet connection), and don’t outgrow your hosting provider too quickly.

With that in mind, you should budget around £4 per month for website hosting. Reliable and affordable hosting providers in this price bracket include [BlueHost](https://www.bluehost.com/) (c. $4 per month including a free domain), [Siteground](https://www.siteground.co.uk/) (£3-4 per month), [1&1](https://www.1and1.co.uk/web-hosting) (£1-3 per month), [GoDaddy](https://uk.godaddy.com/hosting/web-hosting) (£3 per month), and [InMotion](https://www.inmotionhosting.com/) ($6 per month).
